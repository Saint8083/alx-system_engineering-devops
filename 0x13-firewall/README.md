## FIREWALL

Firewalls are categorized as a network-based or a host-based system. Network-based firewalls are positioned between two or more networks, typically between the local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN),[9] their basic function is to control the flow of data between connected networks. They are either a software appliance running on general-purpose hardware, a hardware appliance running on special-purpose hardware, or a virtual appliance running on a virtual host controlled by a hypervisor. Firewall appliances may also offer non firewall functionality, such as DHCP[10][11] or VPN[12] services. Host-based firewalls are deployed directly on the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources.[13][14] This can be a daemon or service as a part of the operating system or an agent application for protection.
