## **C-webServer**
Nginx is easy to configure in order to serve static web content or to act as a proxy server.[19]

Nginx can be deployed to also serve dynamic content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and can serve as a software load balancer.[20][19]

Nginx uses an asynchronous event-driven approach, rather than threads, to handle requests.[21] Nginx's modular event-driven architecture can provide predictable performance under high loads.[22][23]

### How the web work

# Clients and servers

Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.
