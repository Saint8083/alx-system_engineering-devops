What is a Process?
A process can be thought of as an instance of a program in execution. We called this an ‘instance of a program’, because if the same program is run lets say 10 times then there will be 10 corresponding processes.

Moving ahead, each process has its own unique process ID through which it is identified in the system. Besides it own ID, a parent’s process ID is also associated with a process.

The main() Function
A ‘C’ program always starts with a call to main() function. This is the first function that gets called when a program is run.

The return type of the main() function is ‘int’. This is because,, when the main() function exits, the program finishes. And a return type from main() would signify whether the program got executed properly or not. In strict sense we say that if main() returns ‘0’, then the program got executed successfully. Any other return value indicates a failure.
The main() function accepts two arguments. One is the number of command line arguments and the other is the list of all the command line arguments.
