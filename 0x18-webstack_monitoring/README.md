# What is server monitoring?

Organizations that depend on servers that are deployed in the cloud must implement server monitor solutions that help maintain the security of cloud servers while tracking their performance and availability. Server monitoring can have different objectives and track different key performance indicators (KPIs) based on the type of server, but the primary objective of server monitoring is always to protect the server from possible failure that would interrupt service availability.

## How does server monitoring work?

The exact workflow for server monitoring will change based on your chosen server monitoring software solution and the cloud-based server that you are trying to monitor. As your IT organization grows in size and number of deployments, you will need to select and configure a server monitoring tool that regularly collects data from every one of your cloud-based servers.
